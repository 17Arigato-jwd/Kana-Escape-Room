## Overview

**Kana Escape Room** blends retro top-down dungeon exploration with interactive language pedagogy. Players awaken inside locked thematic chambers—a cybernetic detective workshop, a historic stone archive, and a sacred shrine vault. To progress, players must inspect the room, solve arcade trials to discover individual Japanese Kana tiles, and combine them at a crafting workbench to form target Japanese vocabulary words (such as **かぎ** `[kagi]` *Key*, **とびら** `[tobira]` *Door*, and **でぐち** `[deguchi]` *Exit*) to unlock subsequent areas.
